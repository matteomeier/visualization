    "# The federal election 2017\n",
    "The election for the German Bundestag takes place every four years, usually in September. In 2017, on the 24th September the 19th German Bundestag was to be voted for. \n",
    "The government previous to this election was formed by <i>CDU/CSU</i> and <i>SPD</i>. The parties <i>Die Linke</i> and <i> Bündnis 90/Die Grünen</i> (also often referred to as <i>Die Grünen</i>) where part of the parliament as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The German voting system\n",
    "The German voting system gives every person, who is allowed to vote, two votes, the first vote and second vote. With the former one votes for a candidate representative for the respective constituency in which one votes. Every candidate that gets the most votes in a constituency becomes a member of the Bundestag. The second vote gives the voter the opportunity to vote explicitly for one party. In a complex calculation the second votes for each party (along with how many direct mandates they won) are used to determine the number of seats a party gets in the Bundestag. Only parties, which get at least five percent of second votes or win a minimum of three direct mandates will be part of the Bundestag. Another peculiarity to notice, the party <i>CDU</i> can only be voted for in federal states other than Bavaria, and only voters in Bavaria can vote for the <i>CSU</i>. Both parties form a parliamentary group in the Bundestag, which is often referred to as <i>Union</i> (<i>CDU/CSU</i> is used as well)."

    "In the following we are showing the results of this election based on data from the Bundeswahlleiter [4], the official person or institution in Germany to observe and control the election. Furthermore, we will show some more analysis of the election results, especially with respect to the age structure of both the voters and the candidates voted into the parliament. This analysis will be helpful to form stronger and more justified hypothesis later on. Given that the dataset was collected on twitter and a common hypothesis is, that social media is more commonly used by younger people, the age analysis will give a better context for our findings in comparison to the election results. Additionally, there will be visualizations representing the winning party for the first and second vote in every constituency.\n",

    "Based on the votes obtained the number of seats a party gets is calculated. The following visualization shows the number of seats obtained by each party, here <i>CSU</i> and <i>CDU</i> are grouped together, since they form a parliamentary group. A usual way of representing the number of seats in a (German) parliament is a (half) pie chart. Even though this type of a chart is usually not a good way of representing data, since it can be hard to compare the sizes of the segments and thus the identification of smaller differences between categories is more challenging, it can be well justified in this context. The aim of looking at the number of seats a parliamentary group holds is directly connected to the question which groups form a coalition or can get majorities. A pie chart with direct labeling of the number of seats allows the viewer to easier identify which coalitions are possible compared to other types of charts and is thus best suited for the data at hand.

    "The visualization above shows multiple things about the first votes. Firstly, the <i>CDU</i> got the most votes in each of the age groups with the SPD being the second most voted for party. Whereas the <i>SPD</i> scored around 25% of votes in each of the formed age groups, the <i>CDU</i> got more votes with the increasing ages of the voters. Secondly, it can be observed, that <i>Die Grünen</i> have more voters in younger age groups than older age groups. The same holds true for <i> Die Linke</i>, but they have more voters in older age groups than <i> Die Grünen </i> have. The votes obtained by the <i>FDP</i> get slightly less for older age groups. Compared to that the <i>AfD</i> has the most voters in middle-ages age groups. Interestingly, when ignoring <i>SPD</i> and <i> CDU </i> the order of the parties based on the amount of votes is reversed between the youngest and oldest age group. "

    "This grouped bar chart shows the behavior of second votes, which can be used to\n",
    "compared it to the chart above and see some similarities between the voting behavior for first and second votes. For the second vote the general observations from above still hold true, but neither <i>SPD</i> nor <i>CDU</i> have as big of a lead as with the first votes, but they are still the most voted for parties. The biggest knowledge gain from comparing the charts for first and second votes is, that more voters supported smaller parties with their second vote compared to their first vote. To put the results of this in perspective it is important to be aware of the different amounts of people per age group. The bar chart below shows this visually. Unsurprisingly the age group 1958-1972 had the most number of active voters for the 2017 election. Nonetheless a clear trend, that more people are in older age groups is visible. The in comparison low number of voters of the youngest age group can partly be explained by the range of birth years being the samllest for the age group 1993-1996 as well as by the baby boomer generation, that is people being born between mid 1950s to end of 1960s. In context of the charts shown above, this means that the depicted voting behavior of older age groups has a bigger impact on the overall result than that of younger age groups."

In total 76.2 percent of people, who were allowed to vote, voted in the 2017 election. However, this number differed between age groups. We choose to depict this as a line chart. Even though we have categorical data, we are specifically aiming at seeing a trend between the age groups, and decided to use a line chart with marked data points. Due to the date being non-continuous, the lines have the purpose of showing the pattern more clearly. To indicate the discrete data points, we added circle-markers at the respective locations. Additionally we depict the overall voter turnout as another line, to simplify the comparison to it.\n",

As we saw above the age group, that was born in 1947 or before that is the second largest one, but their voter turnout was smaller than for the previous age groups.

    "This chapter presented a recap of the election results. Besides the winners, it is important to keep in mind, that the voting behaviour between the age groups differs as well as the age groups having different impacts on the end results.\n",

    "Overall when looking at the topics and networks visible in the #btw17-dataset, it will be interesting to compare this to the actual results. Thus, this chapters main aim is connecting the analysis of twitter as a network for political discussion and communication with the election results to better understand how these two could be connected and how representative of one another they are."
