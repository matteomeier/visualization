# The #BTW17-Dataset

General idea: For each plot we should add few explaining sentences to answer what we are seeing, what maybe is interesting and stuff like that. Interactive plots with good mouseovers and maybe even filtering. Plotly usually works good with Jupyterbook, despite the javascript. Only ipywidgets don't work together with plotly, but maybe that's not necessary. Otherwise we can also use matplotlib.
