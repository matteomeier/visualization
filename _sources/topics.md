# Topics in the BTW17-Dataset

## Hashtags
Some plotting about the used hashtags, which could reference to certain topics. Different dimensions: party, time, amount in general.

## TF-IDF
We could do the same for some tf-idf statistics, which is easy to calculate. We could also do proper topic modeling, but i think it's out of scope and not that easy on twitter data.
